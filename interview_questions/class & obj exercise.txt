class and object example:

1) create a class called student
create a variable = name and register number using constructor
create a function called display which should display the name and display the name and register number of the student.

class student:
    def __init__(self, name, register_no):
        self.name = name
        self.register_no = register_no
    def display(self):
        print(self.name, self.register_no)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) create a class called fruit
create a variable called color using init method
create a object called apple "pass the color varaiable as parameter through object".

class fruit:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color
    
apple = fruit('red')

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) create a class called teacher
create a variable = name and register number using constructor
create a function called display which should display the name and display the name and register number of the teacher.
creat t1 and t2 object and pass the name and regno value through object.

class teacher:
    def __init__(self, name, r_no):
        self.name = name
        self.reg_no= r_no
    def display(self):
        print(self.name, self.reg_no)

t1 = teacher('t1','001')
t2 = teacher('t2','002')

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4)create a class called calculator.
create 2 variables a and b
create a function called add,sub,mul,div.all function should take 2 variables as a parameter.
pass the a and b value through the object().

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inheritance and polymorphism example:

1)create a base class called shape with a method area() that return 0. 
create a derived class called rectangle that inherit from shape and overrides the area() method to calculate
and return the area of a rectangle.

2)create a base class called person with a constructor that takes a name as a parameter.
create a derived class called student that inherit from person and has a constructor that takes a parameter called grade.
write a method in student to display the name and grade of the student.use super keyword to achieve this.

3) create a base class called vehicle with a metod start() that prints "vechicle started" .
create a derived class called car that inherits from vechicle and overrides the start()
method to print " car started ".

4)create a base class called Employee with properties name and salary.create a derived class called manager
that inherit from employee and adds a property department.write a method in manager to displey the name,salary,and department of the manager.
